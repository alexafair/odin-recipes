    <h5>A delicious bowl of buttered noodles.</h5>
    <p>Saucy, buttered noodles are simple to make and perfect to serve either as-is or 
        alongside steak, chicken, or meatballs. Butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper 
        are all you need for this quick and easy, kid-friendly dish, although fresh herbs 
        and a little lemon juice could be added to amp up the flavor. It's such a delicious 
        recipe, yet I get many questions on how to make it.</p>

    <p>You may be wondering: "Do I really need a recipe for buttered noodles?" The answer, 
        of course, is yes. This kid-friendly recipe results in perfect noodles tossed in 
        exactly the right amount of butter. Once you try these four-ingredient buttered noodles, 
        you'll never go back to your old method again.</p>
