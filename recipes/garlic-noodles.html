    <h6>A delicious bowl of garlic noodles.</h6>
    <p>These garlic noodles are deceivingly simple, yet devastatingly delicious. 
        Garlic noodles were invented back in the '70s at a restaurant in San Francisco 
        called Thanh Long. Usually served with roasted Dungeness crab, the recipe is a 
        very closely guarded family secret, but after lots of investigation, and even more 
        experimentation, I think this is very close.</p>
